# simpleCalculator

A simple porting project to understand JavaFX for Java and Tk on Python.

Both projects have the same functionality, with the only difference being the platform used.

### Known issues
- Cannot multiply or divide by negative numbers
- All evaluations are resolved as a double, so 5.0 instead of 5
